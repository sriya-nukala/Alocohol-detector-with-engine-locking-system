# Alocohol-detector-with-engine-locking-system

**Introduction:**

We have seen much news of accidents caused due to drunk and drive. We have designed a GPS tracker and alcohol detector project to solve the said problem. The project is actuated by switching on the vehicle with the help of the ignition key. This would actuate the working circuit and make the entire unit in a vigilant mode. Alcohol detection is performed in real-time by the alcohol sensor, the microcontroller, and the Analog to digital converter circuit. Thus there is never a situation when the system is in a shadow or a sleep state.

**Description:**

In the drunk and drive detection project, the system (Arduino) is connected to LCD display which displays the alert message once the level of alcohol is measured above a set threshold value. At the same time engine locking is done with the help of deactivating the Relay and DC motor. Then a mail will be sent to the registered mail id with the help of Wifi module. We used _Thingspeak_ platform to connect with IOT devices. 

This system can be fitted in the vehicle's steering wheel to detect alcohol (whether the driver is drunk), slows down the car once it stops sends a message to the registered email address.
